  <h4>Initial Take On Poetry</h4>
  <p>
    It's an odd thing to read poetry. It's an even odder thing to try and write poetry. When I bagan,
      I tried to just write simply. Horrible amounts of repetition. Trying to say something about things
      I did not understand. Then it occurred to me. Poetry is supposed to be the ultimate form of
        understanding. The real test of knowledge is to be able to explain whatever you are trying
        to understand so simply that anyone is able to understand what you are trying to describe.
          Poetry takes this a step further, playing with the words you are describing, so that the
          meaning to what you are trying to say does not lose its value. Instead it enhances the
            experience and creates new insight into what you are describing because it allows for
            this word play to creep in features that you did not originally intend to be there…
              Or maybe you did intend for them to be there.
            </p>
  <h4>Things to remember</h4>
  <p>I am not quiet an expert on poetry. It is still a nery new topic to me and I have a few techniques that I have
    tried to help myself write. Hopefully this list will grow and become better over time. For now, I think 
    this list is good for helping me to remember what about poetry is important.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't stop the flow of writing</li>
    <li>Pick a topic and stick with it</li>
    <li>Don't overthinking rhyming (unless its a particular style)</li>
    <li>Relax and have fun!</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Note to self: </h3>
  <p>Remember, life is about growing and learning from the past mistakes we’ve made. It is the same when trying to learn writing. You have always had a solid grasp on concise engineering writing styles, but now it's time to grow. There is nothing that is stop[ping you from improving your own writing other than yourself. So don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and take the lessons as they come. The ones who provide solid feedback are the ones who truly care about you and want you to grow and succeed. Don’t be deterred by anyone who may say nasty things. It’s never  a personal attack, there is always more to the story and you should remember to let them go as easily as they came. Don’t be afraid, just dream big and make it happen.</p>
