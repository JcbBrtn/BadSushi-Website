    <h4>The Trials of Mastery</h4>
    <p>There is a founded technique that can help you master anything, given the right motivation,
        time, and resources. Just doing it. If you want to be good at something, there is only one thing
        you need to do. Do It. Everyone is a master at finding mistakes. So they will let you know they
        "are better than you" because you made a mistake they can see. Well guess what. Everyone who
        has ever mastered something has started as a beginner, making beginner mistakes. We should not be
        punished for the mistakes we make trying something new. We should be rewarded for attempting to
        better ourselves for trying something new. Yes, the feedback is nice. But feedback is more appreciated
        from an eye that will see beyond the basics that anyone is able to see as a mistake. This trained eye
        will understand the efforts being put in, and see that as more appreciated effort than the blatant
        mistake that it may be.

        While trying anything new for the first time, we are able to get to a certant level on our own,
        because we can look back and see the mistakes we have made along the way. As long as we have the
        image in our head, we can compare it to relatity and make adjustments accordingly. Therefore, the only
        limitiation that we have is the one that we hold in our own mind. That revilation will take us to new heights.
        The teacher, or critic will give us new ideas to shoot for, and help us avoid pitfalls along the way.
        But ultimatley, self reflection, honest self truth, and time is what is needed for mastery.
