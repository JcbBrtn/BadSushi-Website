    <p>The avatar of all things. I have lived my entire life with this ability and never knew about it. Just as Thanos realized the last stone was hidden inside the Stanley cup. Being the good sport he is, Thanos decided to do this the fair way - get his hands on the Stanley cup by being MVP of the next Champion team. His god-like strength would make it a sure-win for any team he chose. So he joined the Brewins as the coach was a long time follower of Thanos, an easy way to make it onto an NHL team. Just as the Avengers were getting word of the plan of attack, that’s when I figured out my ability. Playing soccer, going for my first ever penalty kick. With all my might, I kicked the ball, releasing an earth spike out of the ground to punt the ball for me, with a blast of air directing the kick down so as to not go out too far over the goal. The goalie never saw it coming, and me, falling down as I created a patch of ice where I landed. Stunned and amazed, my team not knowing whether to cheer or to run away frightened. Unsure of the ruling on the field, I quickly walked over to the side line to pack up my things as I could feel the avenger’s vans coming for me. Soon enough, the place was swarming with black, unmarked vans. I hopped in and was quickly greeted by Nick Fury. As it goes, they would normally send my ass to the X-Men to be a mutant with the other children with unknown abilities. However, they’ve seen the TV series, they know what the avatar is capable of, so they wanted to use me as backup. Quickly they told me of the plan. At the Theater is the opening game for the Brewins. The stadium will be filled but this will be our best time to strike, before Thanos becomes a fan favorite, and the first time he will be on Earth, semi-vulnerable. Nick commanded that I let Iron Man do most of the talking since I’m new to the superhero game, and try to do as little as possible since they don’t need another Spider-Man trying to solve everything and only messing it up. I nodded in agreement. After some time, we were outside of the Theater, it was go time. I stepped out of the van, to see all the other avengers. We quickly burst into the main level. The Theater is designed so that the main level is the top row of seats. At the bottom, the arena. Iron man decided it would be best if we split up, Me, Hawkeye, Spider-Man, and Wanda stay up top while the rest travel down to confront Thanos. I watched as each hero, in their own cerimonias fashion, hopped, flew, or simply ran down to the center ring. Thanos just coming out of the locker room, the crowd going nuts, too enamored with the thought of their team winning another championship with Thanos to think of the implications it may have after the celebration. Once down there, Thanos seeing our plan unfold, became enraged. Grabbing Ironman out of the air, and tossing him to the side board. Then, out of thin air, Thanos generates a javelin of energy, set to throw it into the upper deck towards the upper crew. With the crowd now frightened at Thanos’ rage, I quickly reach out, feeling for the water within Thanos’ stomach and skin, and freeze it. I strain myself to hold the might in place. Frozen and confused at this new hero, Thanos tries harder to break free. With all my will power, I hold the icy grasp on Thanos. Right as I could feel my hold dropping, Captain America uses his shield to bash Thanos in the head, knocking him unconscious. Quickly, Dr. Strange Opened a portal and screamed for everyone to go through. I, with the other one’s who were set to stay up top, quickly ran down the stairs of the first balcony. Making my way through the swarming crowd as they wanted to see who this new avenger was. I was more worried about Nick Fury’s rage than making someone’s day. So I burst through the crowd and jumped over the ledge towards the center ice below. Falling, I felt every face and phone light. A weird experience as only moments ago I was just kicking my first ever penalty kick at a soccer game. Before too long, I snap out of my thoughts and use air to lessen my fall, and slow my descent to the ground. Landing on my feet in true Avenger’s fashion, I made my way through the portal, towards a different word altogether.</p>
