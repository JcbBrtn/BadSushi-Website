    <p>I have spent my life feeling that life is a competition. I don't think this is a necessarily wrong way
        to view the world. However, I have definitley let it get out of hands a couple of times. Now, admitting
        mistakes like this is not an easy thing, since you always want to put your best self forward on a static
        platform of the internet. But, I see it now, and I want experiences to be shared, not kept.

        Part of me feels that life is allowed to be a competition at times. It's exciting. It makes for
        memories that we can look at. But it is supposed to be something we bond over. Competition is meant
        to be enjoyed. It's the enjoyment of self improvement, and showing that you are capable. Competition
        makes it that someone else is there to be tried with you. You are tried by them, and they are tried by you.
        It is a cycle of improvment that can have astounding results when done enough, as we all have commonalities
        between how we do things. So, for most levels, continual practice with the same group can greatly refine
        fundamentals and the plays that can be generalized to other plays to create a playbook. When used and
        focused properly, competition can create great motivation, and preformances from everyone involved.

        The one thing that should be acknowledged to not let competition out of hand is the emotion of it.
        I get it - emotion is inevitble when deelign with something ou care about. But we care too much about
        our status, our rank, or our records. We care too much about the things that motivate us, when the
        competition itself is what should be motivating. I'm not saying to stop caring about your opponent
        and their actions; You should ignore the human side of your opponent. The emotion and complexity
        that come from each other is what can bring out the emotions in ourselves. Do not play the game for
        the emotion of the game. play the game for the game's sake. For your improvement. And be paitent with
        yourself. You will adapt, you will change. Just keep playing until you do.
