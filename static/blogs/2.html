    <h4>On adventure</h4>
    <p>I can't stop thinking about it. The want for something, the want for a thrill. Where's the adventure, the exploration of a new place, never before seen or known about. Where's the scaling of obstacles, environmental, personal, social. I guess there is adventure all around us, but none that I yearn for. I desire a hunt for a trophy, one with obstacles, people trying to reach the end before I. One where The climb comes before and after the fall. I desire the action of encounters, where danger is prevalent. Where sacrifices must be made to grow. But where to start? All adventures have a goal, one that was declared early on. Then a commitment is made to this goal, to go and get it. What is the goal? That is where the path lies. The only way to the path is with action, to look and to hunt for a path. Then commit to the path and follow it, along the way, grow, enjoy, and keep the memories. These memories are always more sacred than the trophy will ever be. Every bit of the path is tough, and will make you want to abandon the goal, But that is the adventure. To never give up on the goal.

        <p>To push past the ones that say,</p>
        <p>“You cannot”</p>
        <p>And instead you look at your goal and you say,</p>
        <p>“Yes I can.”</p>
        <p>The strength comes from within, your life is the adventure, It is just your job to see it as such. So go, get on now, adventure awaits.</p>
    <h4>On Self-value</h4>
    <p>Self-value is one of the greatest things to understand in life. It brings happiness in the work that you do, because you understand that there is nothing that truly affects you. You only understand self valuewhen you look not at what you don't have, and begin to appreciate and see all that you have. That is when true self value comes alive.</p>
