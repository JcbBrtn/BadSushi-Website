    <p>I believe we care too much about ourselves. Our image, our appearance, the communities thought of us. We care about this, however, we never ask the question, "What is me?". How are we able to care about ourselves if we have no control over ourselves since we do not understand who is me? Me is the accumulation of the actions you take. Whether the action is speaking to a friend, working all night to get the project in on time, or sending some flowers for a friend in need (just to name a few), the sum of all of these actions is what makes me.</p>
    <p>With this, we must dig further to ask, what do I act upon? Without conversation of free will, it is apparent that we act on what appears to be in our best interest. The thing that has the most emotional pull, or the greatest stimulus. Well, anyone with a masters in Psychology will tell you that an accumulation of stimulus makes an environment. So the thing with the greatest pull from our environment is what we act on, creating who we are. So bare with me as we dig one more step.</p>
    <p>What is our environment? The things around us, our community. We care so much about what the community thinks about us when we are, by transitivity, our own community. Now how does that make sense? That we try to better our appearance, or crack wise at our environment to bring it down, create toxicity, and ultimately pull the value of the things around us down to add value to ourselves when we are the exact thing that we are pulling down. No! That's not a good thing. We should be building our community. The things we want to acknowledge around us, those are the things we should act upon improving. Because the value of ourselves is directly reflected by the value of our community, of our environment. There should be no need to fight, because in the end you're only fighting yourself. Be the better version of yourself by helping your community, your friends, be the best version of themselves. That is where value should come from. Love the ones around you, and in return you will be loving yourself.</p>
