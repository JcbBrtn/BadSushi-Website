    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Lessons From Today</h2>

    <p>One of my favorite movies of all time is one called The Hustler. It was an older Paul Newman movie where
        he goes around hustling people in pool for a living trying to prove that he is the greatest pool player ever.
        This quest lands him in the pool hall of Minosota Fats. During their rounds of play, Paul finds himself up
        and winning against Fats. In a pivotal moment, with Paul drunk off of his success, Fats is in the mirror,
        straightening himself out. Washing off his face, cleaning off his jacket, making sure everything looks perfect.
        Fats proceeds to win all of the next games, taking Paul's money and then some.

    <p>So why tell about this? During my time today, I found myself in the thick of the moment, unable to see
        my own face in front of me. All I needed to do was to take a step back, reasure myself and see the answer, not be
        drunk off the moment. As much as living in th emoment is correct, you must be in the moment with absolutle mindfulness
        of the situation.

    <p>The skills come from the work you put in. Being a loser with skill doesn't take full advantage of the skill.
        Being a winner, you gain full advantage of the skills you have. You are able to pass the losers with more skill
        Than you because you have a clearer sense of the situation and can see where things piece together better.
    </p>
    <p>To achive this clarity and mindfulness, carry yourself openly through every situation, and meditate on the feelings
        you have to see that they are nothing more than distractions. Don't let yourself be caught in the moment. Be a winner.
