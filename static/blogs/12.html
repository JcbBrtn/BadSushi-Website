    <p>Malter, cast to journey the desert for eternity, stumbles up the sand dune. The heat, burdened upon his shoulders. The sand strikes his feet for every step. How could a man like this be? He stumbles and falls, only to get up and keep moving, aimlessly. Struck down by the heat, time after time. His narrative must be strong. A soul screaming for help, crying for its story to be heard, only for the skeleton to hear. No quit, no surrender. Malter’s story is his meaning. He beacons for his story to be heard by someone else, anyone else. Trapped in this desert like his story is trapped in him. Maybe we are his purpose? We, the hypothetical narrator, is  what is driving him. Yes, that must be it. Instead of succumbing to the dunes, he only succumbs when we stop paying attention. We feed him, his soul, his purpose. He keeps wandering, looking around, amusing the thoughts in his head, and keeps on pushing. Making his way to the top of a sand dune, one that is the same height as all the others, but gives the same vast view when looked at from the top. Too bad Malter fails to find the very top and only stumbles over it, falling to the base of the next sand dune. Still making progress. For a moment he lays, could this be it? A Man’s ambition brushed off by a simple trip? No, startled awake as if his soul slapped itself, he jolts up. To his feet, he begins up the second dune. Like Sysiphus, he has accepted his new environment. The heat, he is used to, the sand strikes the same every time. His actions can be different and are. He manages to get up to the top of this dune without a stumble. For a brief moment, he looks out. Shaking his fist at the distance. Perhaps he sees himself there soon. And wants to be there. Even though it is almost exactly the same as where he just was. Going down this dune, he struggles to hold himself up because his legs are still weak. The eternal plane does not have a night, and Malter has never felt the need to sleep, so hsi legs have never gotten the rest they deserve. At the bottom of this slope, he stops. Observing the ground, right where his shadow ends, staring. Seeing the fine line between what is and what is not, night and day, dream and reality. He feels himself there in some sense. Looking down, over himself. He sees himself staring down over himself. An infinite version of himself within his head. Focusing on one at a time, surely he could never be lonely, for perhaps every layer has their own twist to his stories'. This feeling quickly fades as he looks up, a reminder that he is alone. But that is what makes him special. The greatness he is achieving by walking through eternity is nothing that can be understood by the sand he walks over. Only he truly knows his own story, and sees the value in which he has attained.</p>
