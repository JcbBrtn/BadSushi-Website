    <p>Goals are the backbone of our accomplishments. Its incredibly easy to be sucked into the drone of working everyday like you are working for your own goal; but end up working for another person's goals. You need to find what you want to do and do everything you can to acheive it.
        You have been given an incredible gift of life. It is time for you to do what you need to do to be successful. Be the incredible person you want to be. There is nothing stopping you from doing this.
        When you are afraid there are different things for you to think to calm yourself down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone you see and meet will be the same in the end... dead. embaressment will not last forever. In the end, the now is what is important.</li>
        <li>You are doing what you can with what you have. The knowledge is also a piece of that.</li>
        <li>The people that will make fun of you have lost hope in accomplishing things on their own. If they really saw what you are doing, they would respect it. Don't be afraid to see this in others as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It doesn't make sense to waist your talent because you think something is going to happen when you do
        what you want to do. You don't know what's going to happen because you've never done it before. And if you
        really want to do something, you wont let one bad experience stop you. Be the person you need to be.
        Ask for help when you need it. The only bad question is one that isn't asked. And someone who asks a question
        is a fool for a moment. Someone who doesn't ask questions is a fool for their lifetime.
