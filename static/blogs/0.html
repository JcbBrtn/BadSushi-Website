    Go is a language that I have been learning fairly rigorously recently. In fact, it is the reason you are reading this right now!
    It's a highly capable language. With the ability to enable any developer with quickly deployable web applications and fast processing through
    its easily enabled concurrency. Best of all, it is a relatively new language which means it is still supported and regularly updated.
