    <p>We are all brought into this life. And even if it is unfair that we are not given 
        the same amount of time to live, we must choose to find what it is we live for and live for it.
        This is a Purpose. Its the driving force and with purpose, the rest of the puzzle falls into place.
        We are then able to think clearly about our actions. We can take actions with zero worries, because
        we know in our heart of hearts, it is just. Purpose is supposed to be the thing that lights the fire within.
        Something that you look at immediatly and you know - this is what I need to do. Its the one thing you
        should remind yourself of every day. You should see it at the beginning of each day, and think about it
        at the end. Make sure everything you do aligns with this purpose. This will allow you to achieve.
        If you need to revaluate your defined purpose, that is okay. All that matters is that it lights a fire within you.
        It is something you would fight for and die for. It is what gives you drive, and makes you whole.
        This is what purpose is suppose to be. Now just try to find it.

        For myself, my purpose is to repay what was given to me. I have been incredibly fortunate throughout my
        life. I have been given things I do not deserve, and I want to fulfill the purpose of giving to me.
        I don't want to let anyone who invested in me let there resources go to waist. Whether it is to find
        success and give my own resources back 100 fold, or to teach others how to find success of their own,
        this is what I was made to do. My Purpose.
