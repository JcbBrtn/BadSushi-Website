    <p>The world seems to keep getting more and more aggressive at triggering our reptilian brain. The part of the brain that acts on impulse, on our thirst, lust, and greed. Through all this, I still long for a higher consciousness. A sort of nirvana. A level of being where I truly see. This is an important aspect of my life that I strive for. One thing that I recently relearned, is how important is your reaction to everything. Even the things that are good and you strive to give yourself the head fluff of giving into the gluttony. This is just as bad. This is still triggering our reptilian brain. Laughing incredibly hard at a joke. Reptilian brain. Punching back after being punched. Reptilian brain. The more you hold back reactions and observe, the more you begin to see the disconnect between your body and your experience. The division between physical reality and consciousness. This separation is where the crowbar of our mind must be taken, to widen and expose the truth for what it really is. Once there, control will come. Once there, things will be clearer, and we will all be one step closer to the dream of engaging the higher consciousness and creating a life where we are able to live in that state of control and sight.</p>
