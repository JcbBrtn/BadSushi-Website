    <p>My name is Malter. Cast to walk like a distant memory. Never finding a way, and never making it anywhere. The heat of this desert draws my strength. However, I still find energy to walk. It feels better to walk than to lie. Anywhere must be better than where I am at, right? How could I default to lying? I have air traveling into my lungs, enabling me to feel; feel the heat of the sun, the burn of the sand, and the infinitely sinking feeling in my gut. A feeling that knows no lower bounds and has not been towards a higher bound since I was sent to walk this wasteland for eternity. I know what that greater feeling feels like. I have memories of it. Knowing how better it could be. I long for those feelings again. Faint whispers of these feelings come and go as I look around. Little pixies dance across the landscape, fueling me to walk. Maybe one day, one of these pixies will forget what I am. They may forget that I long for the feelings they hold. How could I accomplish this? I would have to become one with the landscape. Knowing nothing but the heat of the sun and the occasional feeling of some wanderer walking over my soft surface, slowly being swallowed by the particles that make up the environment. This would require the loss of my memory. The memory of the life before. The man I was. The family that raised me, and people who shaped me into the person I was. Would losing these memories be worth the goal? When I finally find the feeling that I have longed for from a distance I would not know what to do with it. For the memory is what holds me to who I am. Without it, I am nothing more than another particle of sand that fills this desert. Yes, I desire what I had in the past, but the memories I hold are closer than the pixies that taunt me from a distance. Losing these memories would be the loss of identity, the ultimate loss of an individual. I know I cannot die in this eternal plane, and my work in the past will make sure my identity lives on in the physical plane. What does the past lifeâ€™s memory of me mean to me? They are the ones who have cast me into this role. Never to be seen again. Never to be heard from again. I owe them nothing for they have tried my identity, and found me wanting. This hell has welcomed me with open arms. It has given me a new identity. A wanderer. A lost soul bared against the heat, held up to the flame of humanity and only has the self to identify with. But look closer, does the sand not hold resemblance to myself? What does segregation from the sand mean when there is no one else to perceive survival on this land? Is my soul just cast to become another particle? One grain amongst an eternity of like souls all cast to oblivion to be forgotten? Is this what my fate is? Are these grains really other individuals cast to the same destiny? Or are they different from me? My memory is what holds me separate from becoming another piece of sand. If I hold onto this memory, then I will be different. Unlike the rest who have succumbed to forgetting what was and only live in the now. Feeling that there is nothing better than the cage they sit in. I hold the truth for what this is. I can be different. Will madness take me if I do not live within my environment? If I believe that I can truly escape but never do then my mind will never know what is the right thing to feel. I will never feel what it is like to live in the sand. To be another obscure image stepped on by a wandering soul. So what is obtainable? What do I know that I can feel in this new life? Relaxation? Pleasure? Desire? Drive? What do these matter when I have nothing but myself. My story in this tundra will be lost. No one will learn of or hear from my greatness for I have been exiled from society. But I shall do what is possible, fighting the impossible and willing it into existence. For as long as I breathe I can feel my mind. I can think of what was, and hope that my future will be better than my past. Paddling upstream to what was, for I have lost my way. My identity will be lost to humanity, but I will write my own story and tell myself a new chapter every night as I go to sleep. Waking up to another day of writing. If I do not find the past, then I will keep looking for it. Like an artist, straddling obscurity and madness to write a story that others may attempt to recreate, but no one will ever understand what was truly written.</p>
