Oversimplified or desensitized
to the inner workings of life.
Five hoops for two steps
forward. Progress comes to
a crawl. Chasing dreams never
meant to be. Up in the sky
flying. That is where I'll be.
Away from the drone of life,
circling the stars.
How will I do this, you'll ask.
By simply seeing that the wings
are already attached.
