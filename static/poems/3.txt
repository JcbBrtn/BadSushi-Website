In my mind I do decree,
an ancient rhyme made for thee.
To take the gates of heart
and tear it to shreds at the start.
To climb tall mountains,
toppling hills and falls like fountains.
There you await me.
Dreaming of what will be.
We travel together,
trying to find our adventure.
Under the cover of the night,
We found our flight.
taken aback at all the time we had
set from the source our love
has had no worth.
We have not grown;
we have only flown.
For love is more
than adventure or story.
It grows and cares,
accepting all dares.
Love is a verb.
So send back our time
and fall to the start.
I do not wish for our love
to be without heart.
I wish us to be grounded
by our feet.
So we may meet
our good and bad with equal fear.
And fix as we go
so that we may know
That our love does not grow thin
but flourishes from within.
