A simple glass. Full of life,
with water dripping down the side.
A gift from my own wife.
A lovely woman
full of hope.
She never sees a slope.
Only an opportunity
to rise again.
A remarkable lady
with hair of gold
and an embrace that never grows old.
Oh! What a sight I see,
how wonderful it must be.
To be this simple glass
and all it has encompassed.
